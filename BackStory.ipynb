    "#  Why Java?\n",
    "\n",
    "Java was created to solve the problems of earlier programming languages like C and C++, which were powerful but had limitations such as platform dependency, complex memory management, and lack of portability.\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ Java was designed with the principle ‚ÄúWrite Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)‚Äù.\n",
    "This means a Java program written on one machine can run on any other machine without modification, thanks to the JVM (Java Virtual Machine).\n",
    "\n",
    "Java is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple ‚Üí Easy to learn compared to C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented ‚Üí Everything is based on classes and objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Platform-Independent ‚Üí Code runs on any OS (Windows, Linux, Mac).\n",
    "\n",
    "Secure ‚Üí Provides a secure runtime environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Robust ‚Üí Handles errors and memory management automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "#  History of Java\n",
    "\n",
    "Java was developed by James Gosling and his team (known as the \"Green Team\") at Sun Microsystems in 1991.\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally, the project was called Oak (named after an oak tree outside Gosling‚Äôs office). It was intended for programming consumer electronic devices like TVs, microwaves, and set-top boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1991 ‚Üí The Green Project began.\n",
    "\n",
    "1995 ‚Üí Oak was renamed to Java (because ‚ÄúOak‚Äù was already a trademark).\n",
    "\n",
    "1996 ‚Üí Java 1.0 was officially released with the slogan ‚ÄúWrite Once, Run Anywhere‚Äù.\n",
    "\n",
    "1997‚Äì2006 ‚Üí Several versions of Java were released, improving performance and features (Swing, JDBC, RMI, Collections, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "2009 ‚Üí Sun Microsystems was acquired by Oracle Corporation, and Oracle became the official owner of Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "2011 onwards ‚Üí Oracle continued releasing new versions of Java with improvements in speed, modularity, and security (Java 8 with Lambda, Java 9 with modules, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, widely used in Android development, web apps, enterprise applications, cloud, and big data systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Features of Java\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Simple ‚Äì Easy to understand (no pointers, no header files).\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Object-Oriented ‚Äì Uses classes and objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Platform-Independent ‚Äì Code runs anywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Secure ‚Äì No direct memory access, uses JVM sandbox.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Robust ‚Äì Automatic garbage collection, error handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Multithreaded ‚Äì Supports running multiple tasks at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ High Performance ‚Äì Uses JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Distributed ‚Äì Supports distributed computing (RMI, EJB).\n",
    "\n",
    "# JDK (Java Development Kit)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the complete package needed for Java development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "JRE (Java Runtime Environment)\n",
    "\n",
    "Compiler (javac)\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugger, JavaDoc, and development tools\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ Developers use JDK to write, compile, and run programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "# JRE (Java Runtime Environment)\n",
    "\n",
    "Provides libraries, JVM, and other components to run Java applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does not contain development tools (like compiler).\n",
    "\n",
    "Used by end-users who only want to run programs, not develop them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Java Virtual Machine (JVM) Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The JVM is a runtime engine that executes Java bytecode. Its main components are:\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Class Loader Subsystem\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Loads .class files into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Class Loaders:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrap ClassLoader ‚Äì Loads core Java classes from rt.jar (e.g., java.lang.*).\n",
    "\n",
    "Extension ClassLoader ‚Äì Loads classes from the jre/lib/ext directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Application (System) ClassLoader ‚Äì Loads classes from your project or classpath.\n",
    "\n",
    "Responsibilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "Loads classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Verifies bytecode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provides namespace separation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Runtime Data Areas\n",
    "\n",
    "Method Area: Stores class structures (metadata), static variables, constants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heap: Stores objects and arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Java Stacks: Each thread has a stack, storing frames for method calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "PC Register: Stores address of the current instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Native Method Stack: Stores native (non-Java) method calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Execution Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreter: Reads and executes bytecode instructions one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "JIT Compiler: Converts bytecode to native machine code for faster execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Garbage Collector: Reclaims memory of objects no longer in use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Native Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "JNI (Java Native Interface) allows Java code to call C/C++ code."
