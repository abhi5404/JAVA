    "\n",
    "## 🔹 What is an Interface?\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Java**, an **interface** is a **fully abstract class** that is used to **achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a **collection of abstract methods** (methods without a body) and **constants (final variables)**.  \n",
    "Interfaces define a **contract** that the implementing classes must follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of an **interface as a blueprint** — it tells what should be done, but not how it should be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Key Points About Interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Interfaces use the keyword `interface` instead of `class`.\n",
    "2. All methods in an interface are **abstract** and **public** by default.\n",
    "3. All variables in an interface are **public**, **static**, and **final** by default.\n",
    "4. A class implements an interface using the **`implements`** keyword.\n",
    "5. A class can **implement multiple interfaces** (Java’s way of achieving multiple inheritance).\n",
    "6. From Java 8 onwards:\n",
    "   - Interfaces can also have **default methods** (with body).\n",
    "   - Interfaces can have **static methods**.\n",
    "7. Objects of interfaces **cannot be created directly** — you can only create objects of the implementing class.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🧩 Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "interface InterfaceName {\n",
    "    // constant (variable)\n",
    "    type VARIABLE_NAME = value;\n",
    "\n",
    "    // abstract method\n",
    "    returnType methodName(parameters);\n",
    "}\n"
