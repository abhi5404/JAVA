    "\n",
    "## üß© What is Abstraction?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstraction** is one of the **four main pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** ‚Äî along with **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, and **Polymorphism**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It refers to the **process of hiding implementation details** and showing only the **essential features** of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms:\n",
    "> **Abstraction means ‚Äúshowing only what is necessary and hiding the complex details.‚Äù**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß† Example from Real Life\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about driving a **car**:\n",
    "- You use the **steering wheel**, **accelerator**, and **brake** ‚Äî these are **interfaces** you interact with.\n",
    "- You don‚Äôt need to know **how the engine works internally**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **abstraction** ‚Äî **showing the functionality** but **hiding the inner complexity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚öôÔ∏è Why Use Abstraction?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To **reduce complexity** of code.  \n",
    "2. To **increase security** by exposing only necessary details.  \n",
    "3. To **improve code reusability and maintainability**.  \n",
    "4. To **achieve loose coupling** between class implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß© How to Achieve Abstraction in Java\n",
    "\n",
    "In Java, **Abstraction** can be achieved in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Method | Description |\n",
    "|--------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Abstract Classes** | Using the `abstract` keyword in class and method. |\n",
    "| **Interfaces** | Using the `interface` keyword (fully abstract until Java 8). |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîπ Abstract Class in Java\n",
    "\n",
    "An **abstract class** is a class that is **declared with the keyword `abstract`**.  \n",
    "It **cannot be instantiated** (you can‚Äôt create objects of it), but it **can have both abstract and concrete methods**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Rules:\n",
    "- Declared using the `abstract` keyword.\n",
    "- Can have **abstract methods** (no body) and **non-abstract methods** (with body).\n",
    "- Can have **constructors**, **fields**, and **static methods**.\n",
    "- Must be **extended** by another class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß© Syntax:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "abstract class ClassName {\n",
    "    // Abstract method (no body)\n",
    "    abstract void display();\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Concrete method (with body)\n",
    "    void show() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Concrete method inside abstract class\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n"
