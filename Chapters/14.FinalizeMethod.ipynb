    "✔ What is finalize()?\n",
    "\n",
    "finalize() is a method in the Object class in Java.\n",
    "It is called by the Garbage Collector (GC) before destroying an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its main purpose is to perform cleanup activities like:\n",
    "\n",
    "closing files\n",
    "\n",
    "releasing resources\n",
    "\n",
    "disconnecting database connections\n",

    "It is not guaranteed that finalize() will run.\n",

    "\n",
    "You can request GC using System.gc(), but STILL finalize() is not guaranteed.\n",
