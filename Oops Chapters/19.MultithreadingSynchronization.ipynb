    "## 🟥 What is Synchronization? (Theory)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Java multithreading, synchronization is a mechanism that controls the access of multiple threads to shared resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "When two or more threads try to access the same shared resource at the same time, there is a chance of data inconsistency, race conditions, and unexpected outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent this problem, Java provides synchronization, which ensures that only one thread can access a critical section at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🟦 Real-Life Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a bank account with ₹10,000 balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two people try to withdraw money at the same time using ATM:\n",
    "\n",
    "Thread 1 (Person A) tries to withdraw ₹8,000\n",
    "\n",
    "Thread 2 (Person B) tries to withdraw ₹7,000\n",
    "\n",
    "Without synchronization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Both threads may check balance at the same time (10,000)\n",
    "\n",
    "Both may think “balance is enough”\n",
    "\n",
    "Both may withdraw\n",
    "\n",
    "Final balance may become −5000 ❌ (incorrect)\n",
    "\n",
    "With synchronization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Only one thread enters the withdraw method at a time\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct balance is maintained ✔️\n",
    "\n",
