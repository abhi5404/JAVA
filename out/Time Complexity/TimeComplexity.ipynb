    "# ⏱️ Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Time Complexity is a method used to describe how the execution time of an algorithm grows as the input size increases.\n",
    "Instead of measuring time in seconds, it measures the number of operations performed by the algorithm. This makes time complexity independent of hardware speed or programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if an algorithm processes each element of an array once, the time taken increases linearly as the array grows. Such behavior is represented using time complexity notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📌 Why Time Complexity is Important\n",
    "\n",
    "Time Complexity helps programmers decide which algorithm is more efficient when multiple solutions exist.\n",
    "An algorithm that works well for small inputs may completely fail for large inputs if its time complexity is high.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a sorting algorithm with O(n²) complexity may work fine for 100 elements but will be extremely slow for 1,000,000 elements. Understanding time complexity helps avoid Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) errors in competitive programming and real-world systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📐 Big-O Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "Big-O notation represents the worst-case performance of an algorithm. It tells us the maximum time an algorithm may take for an input of size n.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Big-O ignores:\n",
    "\n",
    "Constant values\n",
    "\n",
    "Lower-order terms\n",
    "\n",
    "Because they do not significantly affect performance for large inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "O(3n + 10) becomes O(n)\n",
    "\n",
    "O(n² + n) becomes O(n²)"
