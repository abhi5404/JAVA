    "# ⏱️ Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Time Complexity is a method used to describe how the execution time of an algorithm grows as the input size increases.\n",
    "Instead of measuring time in seconds, it measures the number of operations performed by the algorithm. This makes time complexity independent of hardware speed or programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if an algorithm processes each element of an array once, the time taken increases linearly as the array grows. Such behavior is represented using time complexity notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📌 Why Time Complexity is Important\n",
    "\n",
    "Time Complexity helps programmers decide which algorithm is more efficient when multiple solutions exist.\n",
    "An algorithm that works well for small inputs may completely fail for large inputs if its time complexity is high.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a sorting algorithm with O(n²) complexity may work fine for 100 elements but will be extremely slow for 1,000,000 elements. Understanding time complexity helps avoid Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) errors in competitive programming and real-world systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📐 Big-O Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "Big-O notation represents the worst-case performance of an algorithm. It tells us the maximum time an algorithm may take for an input of size n.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Big-O ignores:\n",
    "\n",
    "Constant values\n",
    "\n",
    "Lower-order terms\n",
    "\n",
    "Because they do not significantly affect performance for large inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "O(3n + 10) becomes O(n)\n",
    "\n",
    "O(n² + n) becomes O(n²)"

    "## 🧮 O(1) – Constant Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "An algorithm has constant time complexity if the number of operations does not change with input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "int x = arr[0];\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "No matter whether the array has 10 elements or 10 million elements, this operation always takes one step.\n",
    "Hence, the time complexity is O(1).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧮 O(n) – Linear Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "An algorithm has linear time complexity when the number of operations increases proportionally to the input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n",
    "    print(arr[i]);\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If n = 10, the loop runs 10 times.\n",
    "If n = 1000, the loop runs 1000 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the time grows linearly with input size, giving a time complexity of O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧮 O(n²) – Quadratic Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Quadratic time complexity occurs when nested loops are used, and each loop depends on the input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n",
    "    for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n",
    "        print(\"GFG\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "\n",
    "Outer loop runs n times\n",
    "\n",
    "Inner loop runs n times for each outer iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "Total operations = n × n = n²\n",
    "So, time complexity = O(n²).\n",
    "\n",
    "Such algorithms become slow very quickly for large inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧮 O(log n) – Logarithmic Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Logarithmic time complexity occurs when the input size is reduced by a constant factor in each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "for(int i = 1; i <= n; i *= 2) {\n",
    "    print(i);\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Values of i: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ... n\n",
    "\n",
    "Each iteration doubles i, so the loop runs approximately log₂(n) times.\n",
    "Hence, the time complexity is O(log n).\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary Search is a classic example of logarithmic time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧮 O(n log n) – Linearithmic Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "This complexity occurs when a logarithmic operation is performed n times.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n",
    "    binarySearch(arr);\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary search takes O(log n) time and runs n times.\n",
    "Total time complexity = O(n log n).\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficient sorting algorithms like Merge Sort and Quick Sort (average case) fall under this category."
